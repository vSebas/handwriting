# Handwriting

Handwrite, highlight, erase and lasso directly on your notes and PDFs. Your notes stay Markdown.

Open a note and write. The note stays a `.md` file.

**This fork adds handwriting-to-LaTeX.** Lasso an equation, recognize it, review
the result, and insert ordinary Obsidian math. Choose Hand-to-TeX on your device
or UniMERNet running on your laptop. See [setup, iPad workflow, and compatibility](docs/math.md)
and [UniMERNet service setup](services/unimernet/README.md).
The community installation instructions below refer to the upstream plugin;
install this fork's build to use recognition. For BRAT, add `vSebas/handwriting`
and select the corresponding published release. Version `1.4.22-beta.3` adds
the optional UniMERNet provider. Version `1.4.22-beta.4` adds automatic service
startup on the laptop. Version `1.4.22-beta.5` adds setup guidance in Handwriting
settings.

## removing the plugin

your ink is not stored "in" the markdown. it lives in a folder at your vault root, separate from the editor's text.

disable the plugin and your notes STAY EXACTLY THE SAME - the ink just stops rendering. re-enable and it comes back.

one line is written to the invisible frontmatter of a note when you first write on it - `handwriting-page-id`.

a note you never inked on is never modified.

## what it does

Here's a demonstration of some of the features: https://youtu.be/TUeniA9BZcc

* undo/redo ink + text
* draw + pan with the mouse if you want
* pdfs: annotate, export, snip

### features

### required

Obsidian 1.12.3 or newer. please send reports.

## using it

### the toolbar

tap a tool in the toolbar to use it: pen, highlighter, eraser, lasso, insert space or pan. pan lets you drag the page with the pen tip. on a narrow pane, some buttons may move behind **More**.

tap the pen, highlighter or eraser again while it is selected to open its controls. press `Esc` or tap outside the popover to close it.

the keyboard button disables pen input so a tap can place the caret and open the on-screen keyboard. `Pen on / off` does the same from the command palette.

this also applies to pdfs. with the pen disabled, taps pass through to the pdf viewer.

### mouse input

to use the toolbar with a mouse, run `Handwriting: Mouse on / off`.

click a tool to use it with the mouse. click the active tool again to return to the normal cursor.

### eraser modes

the eraser has two modes:

- **stroke** erases the entire stroke
- **reticle** erases only the part beneath the reticle

tap the eraser button to select a mode. stroke is the default.

the eraser button also toggles the eraser on and off. with **Extra commands for hotkeys** enabled, `Toggle eraser on / off` and `Eraser size: next` are available in the command palette.

### colors and favorites

tap the pen button to open its size slider, favorites and 8 pen colors. tap the highlighter button to open its size slider, also with favorites and 5 highlighter colors.

selecting a color applies it to the corresponding nib.

### extra commands for hotkeys

enable **Extra commands for hotkeys** in settings to add these commands to the command palette:

- `Ink color: next`
- `Pen color: next`
- `Highlighter color: next`
- `Ink size: next`
- toggles for eraser, lasso, insert space and pan
- `Pen preset 1` through `4`
- `Highlighter preset 1` through `4`
- a save command for each preset slot

each command can be assigned its own hotkey.

the commands are hidden by default because their number makes other Handwriting commands harder to find. disabling the setting removes them from the palette but preserves their hotkey assignments.

### shape snap

hold the pen still for about a third of a second at the end of a stroke to snap it into a line, triangle, rectangle, circle or ellipse.

with a mouse, pause at the end of a stroke and select **Snap**.

> `.handwriting/` is a hidden folder. many sync services do not sync hidden folders by default, including Obsidian Sync, iCloud and Dropbox.

## how it works

this is a section dedicated to anyone curious about the mechanisms

to sum up: Obsidian's live editor handles the Markdown. transparent canvas layer above it draws the ink. then logic layer decides whether or not the thing poking it is a pen, a finger, or a palm

### where is ink stored

your ink is one json file per note in /.handwriting/

(your vault)/.handwriting/

sidecar is a digital photography term that refers to a small file besides a main file, that holds information about the main file. this is a useful analogy

in this case, the sidecar stores your ink as coordinates - your note is linked to your ink by a single properties line in the properties field of your note. this link + the coordinates tells Obsidian where all the ink is

what this means practically is that no matter what happens to the ink, the text in your note will be safe, as the note itself is not modified (besides its frontmatter).

### why the ink looks good

a typical pen reports ~200-250 dots/events a second. what other handwriting apps probably do (almost certainly) is draw straight lines between each dot - this is what causes the jaggedness or spikiness on boox or other e-ink devices, also because the pen trembles a bit naturally

what i did is smooth the curve by adding the previous dot into the calculation. this causes bad perceived lag, so i had to replace the last stretch of the curve to the pen tip with a straight line in real time

### how does it stay still

ink coordinates are stored in the sidecar. origin is at the top-left of the text column, absolute y down the document.

any transformation of the viewport, Handwriting calculates where that part of the note is on your screen and redraws the ink. then, Handwriting matches the overlay to the live editor pane.

this sounds pretty straightforward. 

however if you resize Obsidian, resize a window pane, change the font size, pinch the screen, zoom with ctrl+, ctrl-, or ctrl & scroll, use a theme that moves the text column, use a theme that moves the live editor, change the readable line length setting, or simply pan, the coordinates must transform to match

### undo/redo

if you draw, type, then erase, ctrl+z should undo those things in the order you did them

this meant Obsidian, not just Handwriting, needed to know what an ink action is and in what order

each ink action had to be translated to be able to be recorded in obsidian's undo history. adding a stroke. moving a lasso selection. which strokes moved and by how much. erasing. what was removed and how much of it

teaching these operations to participate in the editor's history alongside text gives seamless undo/redo for text and ink

if you have any questions i will try to answer as best i can

## reporting problems

[open an issue](https://github.com/ellimist-afk/handwriting/issues/new/choose). report what happened. remember to include which device and pen please.

EZMODE reporting:

run `Bug report: record`.

reproduce the bug.

run `Bug report: send`.

press `Upload` and the report comes straight to me 🙂 paste the id it gives you into your issue or the reddit thread so I know where it came from.

for those of you nervous about sending bug reports: specifically what the report sends are pen coordinates and timings- nothing else. 

and i guarantee nothing will leave your device unless you press `Upload` button. still uncomfortable with telemetry? `Copy` and `Save to Vault` buttons are offline ways to do bug reports

## coming soon

* audio alongside ink
* ruler + compass on screen
* laser pointer
* ocr / handwriting to text ( very soon )
* searchable handwriting ( very soon )
* handwriting to math/latex: available in this fork; see [setup](docs/math.md)
* text boxes ;)
* canvas mode
* more custom colors

## money

## why i built this

back in uni i remember taking biochem notes on a Surface Pro 4 with stars in my eyes. drawing structures and typing labels on the same OneNote page felt like literal magic. ten years later, now for work, I'm still using onenote - and i consider it a prison. 

things change.
 
Obsidian has almost reached feature-parity for me but there's one last integration that keeps me falling back into the hands of Microsoft.

**Handwriting is OneNote's last bastion.**

not to wax poetic but i am beyond ready to break out.

Handwriting is designed for students, educators, engineers, artists, or anyone who needs to handwrite and type in Obsidian.
