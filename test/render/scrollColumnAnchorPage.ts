/**
 * DOES THE NOTE ORIGIN STAY ON THE COLUMN WHEN THE COLUMN RECENTRES?
 *
 * Alan, Throwaway, every note, Readable line length on: ink moves with the
 * scroll and then snaps back, not left-anchored.
 *
 * THE INVARIANT, and it is physical rather than internal: note-space x = 0 must
 * render at the text column's left edge. The committed layer is rasterised once
 * against `lastPaintCam` and thereafter only carried by the band, so where
 * x = 0 actually lands is `bandLeft - lastPaintCam.x * scale`. Comparing that
 * to a FRESH column measurement each frame asks the only question that matters:
 * are the pixels currently on screen standing where the column currently is.
 *
 * WHY THIS DETECTOR AND NOT THE CALL-TIME ONE. An earlier version of this file
 * recorded `scheduleRepaint` at call time, which is right when the overlay
 * NOTICES the origin moved. The mechanism under test here is the overlay
 * failing to notice at all: `originLineObserver` is a ResizeObserver, and
 * InkOverlay's own comment at the field says "A ResizeObserver sees size, not
 * position, so it still misses a column that moves at CONSTANT line width".
 * Under Readable line length the sizer is capped at `--file-line-width` and
 * centred with auto margins, so anything that changes the SCROLLER's client
 * width - a vertical scrollbar appearing as CodeMirror's height estimate
 * settles - recentres the column by half a scrollbar while no line changes
 * size and `.cm-editor`'s box does not change either. Neither observer fires.
 * A detector that only records repaints would be silent through exactly the
 * fault it was built for; this one measures the displacement itself.
 *
 * SCAFFOLDING, DECLARED. Obsidian wraps the editor content in
 * `.cm-sizer > .cm-contentContainer` and vanilla CodeMirror 6 does not - this
 * file builds that wrapper by hand. The shape is taken from the pages in this
 * repo that already model it (columnPage.ts:63, minimalResyncPage.ts:271,
 * cameraPage.ts:200) and from MinimalCameraScale.test.ts:147, which states it
 * in the same words. It is still scaffolding: a red here is evidence about the
 * mechanism, NOT proof that Obsidian's own sizer behaves identically.

			// the setting OFF, which has strictly less room, holds the same point to
			// 0.00 px through the same ladder: a displacement avoidable with less room

			// So the credit is paid only where the state says the stop was real. Read

			// NO CREDIT ON A PREVIEW FRAME, in either setting. Conditioning it on the
			// scroller being at a stop with no range was not enough: below the scale
			// where the granted extent runs out, the product pays d(k_e - k)/k while
			// `maxScrollLeft` reads 0, so the condition holds, the credit pays d(1-k),
			// and the ramp prints re-rooted at k_e instead of at 1 - the same ramp, a

	//
	// Alan, device build 5c1dfdca: "zooming to 10% and then scrolling right and
	// quickly drawing and then scrolling right and then quickly drawing makes
	// lag really really bad", and worse the more the sequence repeats. The
	// sequence IS the measurement: scroll right, commit a stroke, three times.
	//
	// THE SCROLL PHASE AND THE DRAW PHASE ARE COUNTED APART. A cost carried by
	// the grant and a cost carried by the draw want different fixes, and one
	// per-round total cannot tell them apart.
	//
	// THE EXTENT STARTS SMALL, which is the whole difference from the first
	// version of this arm. That one pre-granted 114822 x 65483 - Alan's entire
	// note - so no scroll ever reached virgin surface, ScrollExpansionDemand
	// never reserved, and every counter read zero BY CONSTRUCTION rather than
	// because nothing happened. The grant below is only large enough to make
	// scrollLeft live at all (the host is counter-sized to about 14000 layout
	// px at 0.1 and x cannot scroll until the surface exceeds it); the rounds
	// then scroll PAST it, into the surface the setting has to invent.
	//
	// PER GRANT, NOT SUMMED. Many cheap grants and a few expensive ones are
	// different defects - one wants the grant path throttled, the other wants a
	// single grant made cheaper - and a sum hides which one is here.

  // nobody performed, and the freehand is replaced by a fitted line: 1811, 152
  // and 152 points for 13 pointer events, `pressure` 0.5, `t` in steps of 8 -
  // ShapeSnap.ts:405's resampler. `mappingError` is then null because the

 * `fillRibbon` emits `moveTo` + 3x `lineTo` + `closePath` per SEGMENT, one

 * that puts hundreds of thousands of path calls into one repaint, which is what
 * the device's numbers describe. Many short strokes at the same total sample
 * count would be culled away instead.
