/**
 * The two refusals "Delete all ink" can give a PDF, written once because the
 * first of them is used from three places and three copies of a sentence are
 * three things that drift apart.
 *
 * TWO NARROW RULINGS, AND THEY ARE BOTH ABOUT PUNCTUATION AND CASING ONLY.
 *
 * 1. APPROVED BY ALAN, 2026-09-08: sentence case after the "Handwriting:"
 *    prefix - a sentence starts lowercase, "Handwriting" keeps its capital
 *    wherever it appears, and a command keeps its own name, which is why
 *    "Delete all ink" below is still capitalised.
 *
 * 2. APPROVED BY ALAN, 2026-09-09 18:41 CDT, shown both strings as they were
 *    and as they would be and asked yes or no with no wording touched either
 *    way. His answer, verbatim: "last period off, ones between sentences
 *    stay". So the TRAILING period came off both; both internal periods in
 *    the second string remain. Same rule as `DELETE_ALL_TEMPORARY`.
 *
 * 3. AND HE PUT THE TRAILING PERIOD BACK THE SAME DAY, 2026-09-09 17:14 CDT,
 *    which is the state below. Verbatim: "ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh we hsould be
 *    consistent, put a period back at end".
 *
 *    WHY, because the reason bounds it: a read found that OTHER messages on
 *    this same command always carried trailing periods and had never been
 *    shown to him - "open the note in editing view to delete its ink.",
 *    "removed N strokes. Undo restores them.", the disk-error line. Shown
 *    both readings, he chose consistency in the direction of RESTORING
 *    periods rather than stripping more. The unruled sentences therefore
 *    need nothing.
 *
 *    THE INTERNAL PERIODS ARE UNTOUCHED BY THIS - his 17:18 "yes that's fine
 *    good call" still binds - and no wording changed. One character each.
 *
 *    DO NOT STRIP THESE AGAIN ON THE STRENGTH OF THE 18:41 ENTRY. It is still
 *    on the record and still says the opposite; this paragraph is why. The
 *    authority is the decision recorded 2026-09-09 17:14 CDT, not this
 *    comment.
 *
 *    ONE SENTENCE IS RULED THE OTHER WAY and is not in this file: the
 *    ink-trash restore line stays BARE, because it ends in a file path where
 *    a period reads as part of the path. That asymmetry is deliberate.
 *
 * HE HAS NEVER SEEN THE WORDING OF EITHER SENTENCE, and neither ruling above
 * says anything about it. They are a casing convention and a trailing
 * character. DO NOT READ THIS BLOCK AS APPROVAL OF THE SENTENCES - two narrow
 * rulings stacked under one heading is exactly how an unapproved string comes
 * to look approved, and the shortest route to that is a third one added
 * without this paragraph.
 *
 * Still open with him and NOT to be pre-empted here: the delete-all refusal
 * reason `changed-during-backup` maps onto the second string below, on the
 * note surface it has an approved sentence, and whether that sentence should
 * be extended to this surface is his to rule.

 * because the constructor's own `duration` parameter says so (obsidian.d.ts)
 * - correct whether or not setMessage would also have worked.

 * which also carries the second string below. An earlier revision of this
 * marker said the words had only been relayed and were not on the record; they
 * are now, and this line points at them instead.
 *
 * ONE SENTENCE AT NEARLY EVERY CALL SITE, and the sameness is the ruling
 * rather than an economy. The part that makes it safe: it claims NOTHING about
 * a copy in either direction. Some of these fire before anything has been
 * written and must not imply one exists; three fire after a trash generation
 * was kept and must not imply one does not.
 *
 * DO NOT VARY IT per reason, per surface, or because it reads oddly somewhere.
 * If a call site makes it read wrong, that is Alan's to rule on: name the call
 * site and leave the string alone. That is exactly how the second string below
 * came to exist.
 *
 * THE TRAILING PERIOD IS HIS, AND SO WAS ITS ABSENCE. The whole arc, because
 * half of it invites the next reader to undo the other half:
 *
 *   The period was OURS - added when the constants were formed, never typed by
 *   him. Shown that, he ruled it off all three on 2026-09-09 17:09: "get the
 *   periods OUT", then "GET EM OUT".
 *
 *   He then RESTORED it the same day, 17:14/17:21: "ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh we
 *   hsould be consistent, put a period back at end". The reason bounds it -
 *   other sentences on this same command still carry trailing periods because
 *   he was never shown them ("open the note in editing view to delete its
 *   ink.", "removed N strokes. Undo restores them.", the disk-error notice).
 *   Offered per-string or per-command, he chose consistency, restoring rather
 *   than stripping.
 *
 * Both decisions are recorded at their source, and
 * the earlier one still says the opposite - so read the date before acting on
 * either. A test asserts the BARE form appears in no shipped file.
 *
 * NOT EVERY APPROVED STRING ENDS IN A PERIOD. The trash-restore line is ruled
 * bare - "leave that last one bare" - because it ends in a file path where a
 * period reads as part of the path. It is another owner's, and nothing here
 * may assert a rule that would force it to match these three.

 *
 * An attack found the sentence above is FALSE in one place: at
 * `unknown-readiness` on a note that has never been inked and is open in
 * editing view, there is no ink, so nothing "cannot be deleted" - the old code
 * said "removed 0 strokes" there. His ruling, verbatim: "okay, on a note
 * you've never inked you can say 'no ink on this note'", then "yes, correct
 * you got it" on this exact form.
 *
 * `unknown-readiness` ONLY. Every other refusal keeps the sentence above, and
 * the four cases where it reads as permanent when the truth is "not right now"
 * - `unsettled-record`, `readiness-lost`, `changed-during-backup`,
 * `backup-unverified` - are NOT ruled and must not borrow this one. It would
 * be false at all four: those notes DO have ink.
 *
 * THE PERIOD CAME OFF AND WENT BACK ON, both on his word. The history matters
 * more than the final form here, which is why it is recorded rather than
 * quietly shown - and it has now reversed twice:
 *
 *   His words this morning had no period: "you can say 'no ink on this note'".
 *   WE added one when the string was formed, and his "yes, correct you got it"
 *   was given to the form he was shown, not to punctuation he chose. Shown it
 *   later beside the bare version already live on the ordinary path, he ruled
 *   "no period" (2026-09-09 16:58).
 *
 *   Then, told that other sentences on this same command still carry trailing
 *   periods because he was never shown them, he restored it for consistency
 *   (17:14/17:21): "ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh we hsould be consistent, put a period
 *   back at end".
 *
 * All decisions are recorded at their source, and the

 *
 * SOURCE: the 12:34 decision, recorded before the work began. The sentence below IS his
 * answer - he was shown all eleven reasons rendered as the notices a user
 * actually sees, plus three candidate sentences, and typed this one back
 * himself rather than directing anyone to write it.
 *
 * THE LOWERCASE `try` IS HIS AND IS NOT A TYPO. It matches his other lowercase
 * rulings the same night. No capital T, no em dash, no "please", no rewording.
 *
 * WHAT IT FIXES: at these four the general sentence reads as PERMANENT when
 * the truth is "not right now" - the note is still settling, it stopped being
 * ready mid-delete, or its ink moved while the copy was being made. Trying
 * again works, and the old wording told the user it would not.
 *
 * AND HE WAS OFFERED THE COPY-KEPT VARIANT AND DID NOT TAKE IT. One candidate
 * named the trash generation that three of these four keep. He passed over it
 * and chose the temporary-only sentence, so NOTHING here mentions a copy - not
 * in any form, however true it is of those three. That is recorded because it
 * is the clause a later reader is most likely to "improve" back in.
 *
 * The rule that produced three strings instead of one, kept verbatim because
 * following it twice is what got the wording right: if a call site makes an
 * approved string read wrong, NAME THE CALL SITE AND LEAVE THE STRING ALONE.
 *
 * TWO PERIODS, AND THE INTERNAL ONE NEVER MOVED. He ruled the trailing periods
 * off all three sentences on 2026-09-09 17:09 - "get the periods OUT", then
 * "GET EM OUT" - and RESTORED them the same day at 17:14/17:21 for consistency
 * with the sentences on this command he had never been shown:
 * "ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh we hsould be consistent, put a period back at end".
 *
 * Through both reversals the INTERNAL period after "right now" stayed. It
 * separates two sentences: removing it gives "cannot be deleted right now try
 * again in a moment", which is not a punctuation change but a different and
 * worse sentence, and a re-write is his to type rather than ours to attempt.
 * That reading was recorded in the 17:09 entry for him to veto and he did not.

	 * cleared settingsDirty, so the flush that followed was a redundant
	 * third write of the same object. Obsidian's saveData is not

	 * backgrounding with no further JS, so the write that has to beat the
	 * freeze is the one dispatched synchronously, with no await in front
	 * of it anywhere in the call path from flushOnHide down to here. The

	 * adapter call with nothing awaited first; only the "write again
