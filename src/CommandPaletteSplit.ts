/**
 * The palette split (1.4.12). Alan, 2026-09-05: "people are opening the
 * command palette and not seeing the flatten or the export as svg bc there
 * are too many gd options".
 *
 * ONE table, read by three callers, which is the whole point of the file:
 * main.ts registers from it, the settings tab lists it under the switch, and
 * the test pins it. A list rendered from a second copy would drift, and the
 * row promises "these are the commands you get" - a promise only a shared
 * table can keep.
 *
 * The generated entries (per-colour, per-size) are computed here from the
 * same `PEN_COLORS` / `HIGHLIGHTER_COLORS` / `INK_SIZE_STEPS` main.ts loops
 * over, in the same order, so adding a colour adds it to the settings list
 * and the registration in one move.
 *
 * QUICK PENS' sixteen preset entries are in the gated set too (`PRESET_COMMANDS`,
 * InkPresetCommands.ts), and are borrowed from that file rather than restated
 * here. They are the one gated group main.ts does not spell out - it hands
 * `addGatedCommand` to `registerInkPresetCommands` and the table does the
 * naming - so a copy in this file would be the second list this file exists to
 * prevent, and the settings row would promise ids nothing registered.

 * colour swatches hit in the 2026-08-31 audit ("a fresh install had a palette
 * of dead swatches", InkColor.ts).
 *
 * So registration is what the setting gates, not the ACTION. main.ts files a
 * callback here for exactly the commands it kept OUT of the palette, which
 * makes `runGatedCommand` a decision rather than a guess: it answers true only
 * when the id is one the palette does not have, so the two exec bridges
 * (main.ts's pdf strip, InkOverlay.ts's note strip) can try it FIRST and fall
 * through to `executeCommandById` for everything else. No reading of
 * Obsidian's private registry, and no way to run a command twice.
 *
 * Hotkeys and the palette still see only what is registered, which is what the
 * ruling asked for.

 * identity in `DEFAULT_FOLD_ORDER` and in every fold order already saved to a
 * user's data.json, so the id cannot be renamed without silently dropping
 * their arrangement. So the ACTION is filed, exactly as a gated command's is,
 * and `runGatedCommand` answers for both.
 *
 * SEPARATE FROM `actions` BECAUSE THE SWITCH MUST NEVER SEE IT.
 * `gatedCommandActionIds()` feeds `planGatedCommands` as the `mirrored` half,
 * and that function folds any mirrored id into the set it decides for. A
 * retired id filed in `actions` would therefore be planned for `toUnmirror`
 * the moment "Extra commands for hotkeys" went on - its fallback dropped, and
 * nothing registered in its place, because main.ts holds no definition to

/**
 * WHICH IDS MOVE WHEN THE SWITCH MOVES (1.4.12).

 * the session. A live switch is that same decision taken again at any moment,
 * from wherever the halves currently stand - a pure question, answered here
 * rather than in main.ts so it can be tested without an Obsidian to run.
 *
 * THE INVARIANT, and why the mirror target is written as one expression rather
 * than a second rule: a gated id is registered OR mirrored, never both and
 * never neither. Registered, and it answers the palette, a hotkey, and
 * `executeCommandById` - which is what the strip falls through to. Mirrored,
 * and it answers `runGatedCommand`, which the strip tries FIRST. Both, and the
 * palette holds a command the strip will never reach through it; neither, and
 * the strip button is dead, which is the failure this whole file exists to
 * prevent. `wantMirrored` below is `!wantRegistered` and nothing else, so the
 * two cannot drift apart no matter what the caller passes in.
 *
 * `canRemove` is the honest half. Un-registering needs `Plugin.removeCommand`
 * (obsidian.d.ts, since 1.7.2) or the app's own command registry; where
 * neither exists, turning the switch OFF cannot take anything out of the
 * palette, so those commands stay registered and stay unmirrored - the state
 * that was already true - and the row keeps its reload sentence. Filing
 * mirrors for commands that are still in the palette is the one move that
 * would break the invariant, and this is where it is refused.
 *
 * Idempotent by construction: the plan is the DIFFERENCE between where the two
 * halves are and where they belong, so applying it and asking again returns
 * four empty lists. Toggling on twice registers once.
