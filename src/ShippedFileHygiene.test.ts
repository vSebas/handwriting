/**
 * NOTHING SHIPPED NAMES HOW IT WAS BUILT.
 *
 * Internal coordination details do not belong in shipped files. Public names
 * of supported services, such as the Codex integration, are part of the product
 * and must remain available in the UI and setup documentation.
 *
 * What this catches is mostly not credit lines. It is source comments citing
 * internal coordination files BY PATH as the authority for a user-facing
 * string: those leak the process, the file layout of a machine nobody else has,
 * and role names, into a repository people read. A decision and its date belong
 * in a comment; where it was written down does not.
 *
 * THE TERMS ARE ENCODED, and that is the point rather than an affectation. The
 * first version of this file spelled all of them in plaintext and then excluded
 * itself from its own walk - so the guard was simultaneously the largest
 * remaining instance of what it bans, and arranged not to see itself. Encoded
 * and decoded at runtime, the file is inert to its own pattern and no
 * self-exemption is needed: it is walked like everything else.
 *
 * WORD BOUNDARIES ON THE NAMES, deliberately. Without them one of them matches
 * inside `contrastRatio`, which occurs twenty-odd times in the ink theme and
 * snip code - the first run failed on exactly that and nothing else. The path
 * and phrase patterns stay unbounded, because they cannot occur inside an
 * innocent identifier.
 *
 * `docs/demo.js` is excluded: a build artefact, checked byte-for-byte by
 * `check:site`, never hand-edited.
