/**
 * The 1.4.12 palette split, pinned where it can actually break.
 *
 * Three claims, and none of them is behaviour this repo can execute: every
 * command is an `addCommand` callback needing a real plugin `this`, which is
 * why CommandPaletteNames.test.ts beside this one reads source too. What is
 * worth pinning is structural anyway -
 *
 *   1. every gated id registers under the gated path, with the name the table
 *      says it has, so the list Settings prints is the list the palette gets;
 *   2. the canvas entry commands register while parked `Canvas tool:`
 *      commands cannot come back through a merge unnoticed;
 *   3. the settings row prints the table rather than a second copy of it - the
 *      one thing that makes claim 1 worth anything;
 *   4. the two ROUTES a gated command can answer through - registered in the
 *      palette, or mirrored for the pen toolbar - stay exclusive across every
 *      flip of the switch, which is what `planGatedCommands` is for and what
 *      the machinery under it (`setGatedCommandAction`, `runGatedCommand`,
 *      `clearGatedCommandAction(s)`) had no test of its own for at all;
 *   5. the settings handler actually runs that plan, so the switch is live
 *      rather than a value the next reload happens to read.
 *
 * Source text via `?raw`, comments blanked with `codeOnly`, both for the
 * reasons that technique carries everywhere in this repo. The settings slice
 * normalises CRLF and asserts BOTH anchors were found: a slice that silently
 * became the whole file would pass every `toContain` below for free.
