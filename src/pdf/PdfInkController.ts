 * Ink on a PDF view: one overlay canvas per live page, kept in step with a
 * viewer we never touch.
 *
 * The whole integration is observation. We add canvases inside page divs and
 * read geometry; we do not patch pdf.js, do not call into Obsidian internals,
 * and do not require any API to function. What can break is markup, and
 * markup breaking turns into "no overlays" rather than a crash, because every
 * read goes through PdfViewerProbe and every failure there returns null.
 *
 * Two M0 findings shape this and neither was in the design:
 *
 * - Page divs are NOT virtualized. All 100 exist in a 100-page document, so
 *   an overlay per div is 100 canvases. Overlays follow the viewer's CANVAS
 *   window instead - the pages it has actually rendered - which is a policy
 *   Obsidian has already tuned, and which we then drift WITH rather than away
 *   from.
 * - Page geometry is stable and scroll-independent, so scrolling alone needs
 *   no repaint. Only the live set changing, or the scale changing, does.
 *
 * M1 is read-only: this renders stored ink and captures nothing. Input is M2.

		// already was.
		//
		// `strokeAbandoned` itself, not a hand-copied half of it. This line

		// teardown answered differently: the blur path (which abandoned too,
		// until the 2026-09-04 ruling made it commit) put the reticle away and
		// this did not, and the ring - with `handwriting-pdf-hover`'s `cursor:
		// none` over the whole viewer - was carried onto the new document.

		// model disagreeing about what was still down (1.4.10-design.md §17
		// deferral (2)). A switch with nothing live still touches none of it
		// (2e880b4: abandon is a true no-op with nothing live, `guardApplied`
		// included).
		// The ASSIST-PAN stand-down was left out of this round on purpose. It
		// is the other thing a switch could plausibly reset, and resetting it
		// would un-protect a contact that is still on the glass: the assist
		// pan exists to carry a two-finger gesture that is mid-flight, and a

		// it down would hand a live contact straight back to the viewer's own

	 * through the router's `finishActiveStroke()` -> `penUp()`, the rule
	 * `docs/manual.md` already states for the viewer rebuilding under the pen.
	 * What still arrives here is the teardown that really does drop a stroke:
	 * `forgetHistory()`, the in-place document change, where the pane is
	 * showing a different file and committing the old one's fragment onto it
	 * would be worse than losing it. The note surface's twin carries the same
	 * split for the same reason.
	 *
	 * The strip first, and byte-for-byte the note's line. `stripPenDown` ran
	 * at contact, and abandoning ends the stroke without a PointerEvent, so
	 * nothing reaches `penUp()` to put it back - the strip and pill would
	 * stand `is-inking` (styles.css: opacity 0 AND visibility hidden, so
	 * unhit-testable, not merely invisible) until some later stroke completed.
	 * Deliberately NOT `penUp()` itself, which commits ink, ends metrics and
	 * closes an erase batch for a stroke that is being dropped.
	 *
	 * THE SURFACE'S OWN GESTURE STATE IS THE OTHER HALF, and for two releases
	 * this method was the chrome half alone. `builder`, `erasing`, `lassoPts`,
	 * `spaceLineY`, `dragFrom`, `frame` and `wetBegun` all stayed set, because
	 * the one path that clears them is `resetGestureState()` and no teardown
	 * without a lift reached it. `get idle` is computed from five of those,
	 * and main.ts skips a pane that is not idle when reloading ink - so a
	 * document switch mid-erase or mid-lasso left that pane silently refusing
	 * another device's ink for the life of the view, with nothing on screen to
	 * say so. `resetGestureState` names exactly that hazard in its own header.
	 * `forgetHistory` calls it unconditionally afterwards for the state a
	 * switch inherits with nothing live; this is the half that has to run
	 * while `erasing` and `builder` still say what the gesture WAS.
	 *
	 * The reticle goes with it. Hover has gone quiet under a claimed contact,
	 * and for a mouse there is deliberately no watchdog left to catch it
	 * (a7eba85), so nothing else would take the ring - or
	 * `handwriting-pdf-hover`'s `cursor: none` over the whole viewer - away.
	 *
	 * AND THE WET TRAIL, which `resetGestureState` cannot take off: it clears
	 * `wetFrom` and `wetBegun` - the bookkeeping that says a wet stroke is in
	 * progress - and the samples already painted on the canvas are not state,
	 * they are pixels. The one path that clears them is `penUp`, and an
	 * abandoned stroke by definition never reaches it, so a half-drawn stroke
	 * stayed lit on the page across the switch - the OLD file's ink, painted
	 * over the new one, never committed anywhere - until some later gesture
	 * happened to draw on the same layer.
	 * Cleared, not committed: `penUp()` would store the fragment, and a
	 * stroke torn down with no lift is dropped on this surface exactly as it
	 * is on the note's (InkOverlay.strokeAbandoned clears both its wet layers
	 * and restores the highlighter element the same way).
	 *
	 * The file-switch path DOES come through here, as of this branch's
	 * fix-up: `forgetHistory` reads `router.abandonActiveStroke()` itself -
	 * it has its own reason to, and its own unconditional
	 * `resetGestureState()` for the state a switch inherits with nothing live
	 * - and calls this when the boolean says a stroke was really torn down.
	 * It carried a hand-copied `stripPenUp` before that, and the copy had
	 * already drifted: no reticle, and no wet clear either.
