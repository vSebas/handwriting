/**
 * ONE CEILING, FOUR SITES (MAXZOOM-6). Folded in from an independent,
 * uncoordinated draft (`maxzoom-6-cells-1420`, 12707122) written against the
 * two InkOverlay.ts sites known at the time; this version adds the third
 * InkOverlay.ts site and the MobileTools.ts button-disable site that this
 * branch's own fix touched.
 *
 * The note's maximum zoom is written in four places, and only one of them is
 * the named constant's definition:
 *
 *   src/inline/PinchScale.ts   MAX_PINCH_SCALE, the clamp every pinch goes through
 *   src/inline/InkOverlay.ts   applyPinchScale's preview-branch `next > MAX_PINCH_SCALE` guard
 *   src/inline/InkOverlay.ts   zoomNoteBy's `Math.min(MAX_PINCH_SCALE, ...)` clamp, the +/- buttons and commands
 *   src/inline/InkOverlay.ts   commitCameraScale's `next>MAX_PINCH_SCALE` refusal, the last gate before a commit
 *   src/inline/MobileTools.ts  the "+" button's `zoom>=MAX_PINCH_SCALE` disable check
 *
 * `ZoomFloorLock.test.ts` and `MobileTools.test.ts` already pin the BEHAVIOUR
 * at each of these sites (a commit/preview/button reaching the real ceiling,
 * the plus button disabling at the right point). This file pins the SOURCE
 * instead: it reads the identifier each site references out of the file text
 * and requires it to be `MAX_PINCH_SCALE`, not a numeral. A literal that
 * happens to equal today's ceiling would still pass every behavioural test
 * and drift silently the next time the constant moves - which is exactly the
 * gap Reviewer F1 caught on 772960c7 (two bare `4`s survived a change to the
 * constant because nothing read the source to check). Node only: no render,
 * no browser.

/**
 * MAXZOOM-6 (Fleet 3 c2): does raising the ceiling put a wide, magnified note
 * out of MAX_VIEWPORT_LAYOUT's reach?
 *
 * MAX_VIEWPORT_LAYOUT (PinchScale.ts, 8,000,000) bounds the viewport's own
 * LAYOUT-px box - `handleResize`'s `width/this.pinchScaleNow<=MAX_VIEWPORT_LAYOUT`
 * (InkOverlay.ts ~3179), the preview/settle guards' `layout.width/next<=...`
 * (~5418, ~5572), and `commitCameraScale`'s own bound on `target.left/top`
 * (~7455) - never the note's ink-content width directly. Every one of these
 * divides a screen/pane dimension BY the scale before comparing it to the
 * constant, so a HIGHER scale can only shrink the tested quantity: whatever
 * passed at 400% passes at 600% by construction, and nothing that failed at
 * 400% can newly pass either. The cell below is that argument made concrete
 * with the actual arithmetic at both ceilings on a wide (3000 note-px) note,
 * rather than left as an assertion about the source.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER: whether the note's own SCROLL RANGE - the native
 * scrollWidth/scrollHeight a 3000-note-px-wide document's column-anchored
 * pinch actually lands on at 6x, and whether the x-anchor keeps the column
 * centred there the way tonight's RLL fix does at every OTHER scale - is
 * correct. That is `test/render/ScrollColumnAnchorPinch.test.ts` /
 * `scrollColumnAnchorPage.ts` territory: it needs the real column-measurement
 * and paint path the render harness drives, which no node-only cell can
 * stand in for honestly. Surveyed, not added tonight - see the handback notes
 * for the exact ramp/pauseAt extension this needs once render-suite time is
 * clear (the render suite launches a real browser; something else is already
 * using it tonight per the original brief, and `chrome-headless-shell` is
 * confirmed running as of this pin).
