/**
 * Ink for the inline overlay: session state plus (M1) sidecar persistence,
 * keyed by vault file path.
 *
 * The path is the key because that is the only identity an unclaimed note has
 * (identity rule #1). That makes the vault's rename/delete events part of
 * this store's contract, not an optional nicety:
 *
 * - RENAME moves the ink with the note. Without this, retitling "Untitled 1"
 *   strands its ink under the old path, and the NEXT "Untitled 1" the user
 *   creates inherits a dead note's ink. That exact leak shipped in v0.9.0.
 * - DELETE drops the ink. A path freed by deletion is a fresh note's name.
 *
 * Persistence follows the two standing identity rules exactly:
 *
 * - The reference must exist before the referent: the first commit on an
 *   unclaimed note AWAITS the `handwriting-page-id` write into the Markdown before
 *   any sidecar keyed by that id is scheduled. Commits racing the claim are
 *   chained behind it.
 * - Absence of an id never means anything but "not claimed yet". If the claim
 *   discovers the file already carries an id (another pane, another device,
 *   or a metadata cache we read too early), that id WINS, and its existing
 *   sidecar is loaded and merged BEFORE our strokes can overwrite it.
 *
 * Coordinate worlds never mix: a sidecar without `surface: "inline"` is a
 * legacy canvas page. The inline layer neither renders nor overwrites it.
 * Ink drawn there stays session-only, and the user is told so once.

	 *
	 * So an INVENTED field the artifact does not carry is not compared. It
	 * cannot have been lost by a byte copy of a file that never held it, and a

	 * not name" would drop a stroke's whole geometry on an older file and call
