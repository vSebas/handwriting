 * so every reused renderer works unmodified.
 *
 * The pen hot path is the frozen pipeline verbatim: synchronous draw inside
 * `pointerrawupdate`, coalesced samples, live raw head + smoothed tail. The
 * only editor-derived values it touches are two numbers cached at pen-down.
 * Scroll/reflow repaints of committed ink are rAF-throttled and never run
 * during a stroke's wet path.

	 * The line's rendered size is downstream of ALL of them, so this trigger
	 * does not care how a theme or a settings plugin delivers the change.
	 * Widening `metadataObserver`'s `attributeFilter` was rejected outright:
	 * it is registered with `subtree: true`, so a class filter would fire on
	 * every `cm-activeLine` toggle - a callback per cursor move whose record
	 * array grows with the edit batch.
	 *
	 * A ResizeObserver sees size, not position, so it still misses a column
	 * that moves at CONSTANT line width - a sidebar while `width:
	 * var(--line-width)` is the binding that decides, where the line neither
	 * moves nor resizes but the editor does. That one is the editor
	 * observer's, and `handleResize`'s origin compare already covers it.

	/**
	 * Z10: WHERE THE LADDER IS THE DEFECT, NOT THE CURE.
	 *
	 * The ladder exists because a large rect is rounded at its magnitude: on the
	 * transform host `.cm-content`'s top is a float32 far from the screen, and
	 * that rounding moved the camera every frame. On a css-zoom host the same
	 * rect is not rounded at all. Blink stores zoomed positions as LayoutUnits
	 * (1/64 of a layout-zoom px) and the web-exposed scroll offset is a whole
	 * px, so the rect top is an exact dyadic value that float32 carries without
	 * loss - and `anchorTop` is exact.
	 *
	 * The ladder, on that host, is not. The rung's zoomed top is TRUNCATED to
	 * 1/64 (`LayoutUnit(float)`), so its implied document top is off by the
	 * dropped part, plus `rungTop x (zoom - cssScale)` where the measured scale
	 * is itself a truncated width over an integer offsetWidth. At adoption
	 * `gateAnchorParity` sees that difference, refuses the ladder, the next sync
	 * falls back to `anchorTop`, and the camera moves back: two camera-only
	 * whole-world redraws per refusal (LagAtLowZoom's far and fractional arms;
	 * recorded per sync in `test/render/z10Recorder.ts`).
	 *
	 * So the ladder is bypassed exactly where `anchorTop` is exact, and nowhere
	 * else - everywhere else the ladder path runs as it did:
	 *  - the host form in force is css zoom, with no transform of its own, and
	 *    the measured scale is the host's zoom and nothing more. An ancestor
	 *    transform would put a non-dyadic factor into the rect; the measured
	 *    quotient is within 2/offsetWidth of the product when it is only the
	 *    width's own truncation (the fd04036e bound);
	 *  - the layout zoom factor is 1 or 2. Page zoom and display scaling enter
	 *    Blink as a layout zoom factor the rect is divided by; at 1.25 the rect
	 *    reads 11468.7998046875 where 1 and 2 read 11468.796875 (measured,
	 *    real device scale factor). `devicePixelRatio` is how that factor is
	 *    seen from here;
	 *  - the coordinate is inside float32's exact range at that grid:

	 * is correct only while the column's position is a pure scaling of where it
	 * was - true when the column starts at the host's origin, false when Readable
	 * line length auto-centres `.cm-sizer` inside it.
	 *
	 * `applyViewportBox` re-lays the host out at `layout.width / k`, so the
	 * centring margin is recomputed every preview frame and the column lands at
	 * `(W - lineWidth*k) / 2`, while the raster merely scales about the origin.
	 * The gap is `W * (k/k0 - 1) / 2`: zero at k = k0, negative zooming out,
	 * growing the further the gesture goes, healed at pinch end because
	 * `commitCameraScale` re-rasters against the settled column. Measured in the
	 * render harness before this existed: at W 1398, k0 1 -> k 0.1 the ink sat
	 * 629.125 px LEFT of the column - W * 0.45 to three decimals - and healed to
	 * exactly 0 at settle. Alan, Orion, Readable line length ON: "the ink moves
	 * when zooming out".
	 *
	 * BOTH TERMS ARE HOST-LOCAL AND CAPTURED ATOMICALLY. The first cut compared
	 * `lastSyncContentLeft` against `pinchRasterScale`, two fields written by
	 * different methods at different moments: hold a pinch still past
	 * `PINCH_SCROLL_QUIET_MS` and `deferPinchRaster` goes false, any of six
	 * `syncCamera` callers rewrites the column at the CURRENT scale while the
	 * stored scale still describes the raster, and the offset is then wrong by
	 * the whole ratio. `rasterColumnLocal` is latched in one statement from one
	 * DOM state, at the moment the raster it describes was drawn, and re-latched
	 * whenever a repaint actually redraws that raster.
	 *
	 * READABLE LINE LENGTH OFF IS UNTOUCHED, by construction rather than by a
	 * flag: the column is then a fixed offset inside the host (zero, or the
	 * scrollbar gutter), so the local value is scale-invariant, the difference is
	 * exactly 0 and no transform is written. The same holds for any constant
	 * local inset.
	 *
	 * COLUMN NOT FOUND leaves the offset alone: a frame where the scan cannot see
	 * the column has no better answer than the one already on screen.
	 *
	 * WHAT A PREVIEW FRAME COSTS, counted rather than estimated. ONE forced
	 * synchronous layout: this reads after `applyViewportBox` has written, and it
	 * must, because the column it needs is the post-box one. Rect reads are 12 in
	 * the ordinary case, 24 bounded, 36 if phase B runs (ContentOrigin.ts:59, :72,
	 * :244-247). A latch frame does 2 reads and still only 1 forced layout. The
	 * host rect is NOT cached across the gesture: a pan moves the host.
	 *
	 * The deferred-repaint latch beside this costs at most ONE timer per
	 * PINCH_SCROLL_QUIET_MS while a repaint is being held - about 8 wake-ups a
	 * second, and zero when nothing is pending - against the 60/s a re-armed
	 * requestAnimationFrame would have cost for the whole gesture.
	 *
	 * This spends on exactly the path `deferPinchRaster` exists to keep cheap, so
	 * it is worth saying plainly that it is a layout read per gesture frame and
	 * nothing outside a preview. Computing the column from the layout box instead
	 * of measuring it would remove the read entirely; that is a post-1.4.19
	 * option and should be gated on a profile, not on this comment.

	 * Keep CodeMirror from measuring for the preview lifetime.

	 * THE WRITER OF THE MID-PREVIEW SCROLL IS CODEMIRROR. Every preview frame
	 * writes the counter-sized host box and its scale; CodeMirror's observer
	 * schedules a measure for that, and `EditorView.measure` (6.38.6) reads
	 * `scrollTop` with its previous `scaleY`, refreshes the scale, then writes
	 * `scrollTop = S x k_prev / k_next` back, keeping its scaled scroll
	 * constant across a scale change its ancestor made. That write lands in
	 * CodeMirror's animation frame, after this frame's pan solve and before
	 * the paint, so the pan is one rescale behind on every frame it runs.
	 * Measured on the far fixture at scrollTop 114820, k 0.10 -> 0.11: the
	 * write was 105252, about 1052 visual px, and text and ink left the pane
	 * together, registration intact (2026-09-13, lag-far-xy-fixture d4nav2).
	 * The preview needs no measure of its own: it is a transform and a
	 * translate, and its reads are client rects. So the scheduling entry is
	 * held for the preview and released on every end path, where CodeMirror
	 * then measures once against the settled layout, which is also where the
	 * plugin's own settle requests go. Other callers' requests made meanwhile
	 * are kept, last per key as CodeMirror itself keeps them, and replayed at
	 * the release. What goes with the write: the two or three CodeMirror
	 * measures a preview frame paid before.
	 *
	 * TWO ENTRIES ARE SHADOWED on the instance, and both are needed.
	 * `requestMeasure`, the public scheduler, is where the resize debounce,
	 * the mutation flush and every other caller arrive. `measure`, the sink,
	 * is where a callback CodeMirror scheduled BEFORE the hold went on still
	 * arrives (its animation frame resolves `this.measure` at call time), and
	 * where the synchronous measure a scroll event runs arrives - and the
	 * browser raises a scroll event on its own when a zoom-out shrinks the
	 * scroll range under a far scroll and clamps it. Holding the scheduler
	 * alone leaves both of those to rescale the scroll under the pan.
	 * `measure` is not in CodeMirror's typings (marked internal); a build
	 * where it is absent degrades to holding the scheduler only.
	 *
	 * A swallowed callback leaves CodeMirror's own "measure scheduled" mark
	 * set, and its public scheduler queues without scheduling while that mark
	 * is set, so the release does not rely on it: when anything was held, the
	 * release runs the captured `measure` itself in the next animation frame,
	 * which drains every queued request and clears the mark (a destroyed view
	 * returns from it at once). Each shadow is inert once its hold is over:
	 * a caller that kept the function, or a wrapper that displaced it, reaches
	 * the callable captured at install, never the live property, so no wrapper
	 * chain can loop. The release puts back what it displaced only where the
	 * property is still its own. Re-armed on every preview frame;

  * of where the engine's own centring puts the column - 7.75 px, at every zoom, on both themes.

 /**
  * The inputs of Readable line length's auto-centring term, read in an
  * UNOWNED layout (takeover, a pane resize, a theme refresh), so that
  * `applyViewportBox` can write the term as a number on every frame with no
  * read of its own. The stylesheet used to compute it as
  * `(100% - var(--file-line-width)) / 2`; under the zoom host the engine
  * resolves that `100%` in a mixed basis (the scroller's width with its
  * scrollbar counted in screen px), so the term shrank with k and won the
  * clamp against the frozen column: a column 7.5 (1/k - 1) local px left of
  * where it was, and a hop of that size when a pinch settled.
  *
  * `hostWidth` is the host's local width in this layout. Read only through
  * `measureNaturalColumn`, so the plugin's zoom is never on the host here and
  * local px are the host's own. Returns:
  * - `lineWidth`: `--file-line-width` when it is plain px (the old rule's own
  *   term), else the sizer's computed `max-width` in px;
  * - `fixed`: what the host holds beside the scroller's content box that does
  *   NOT scale - everything outside the scroller, plus its border and padding;
  * - `scrollbar`: the scrollbar at the host's own size (`offsetWidth -
  *   clientWidth - borders`, an integer difference, exact for an integer
  *   scrollbar). Under css zoom it keeps this screen size, which is why
  *   `applyViewportBox` divides it by the zoom.
  * Null when the line width is not px: `applyViewportBox` then leaves the
  * property unset and the stylesheet's percentage fallback applies, as before.
  * NOT COVERED: a scrollbar that appears or disappears with k (a note short
  * enough to stop overflowing at some scale) keeps the value read here until
  * the next resize or theme refresh.

	 * A live gesture was torn down inside the router with no pointerup: a

	 *
	 * The blur twin of update()'s path-change branch, which is where each of
	 * these lines comes from - the same stale state, reached without a switch,
	 * and the branch that repairs it can never run because no path changed.
	 *
	 * NOT THE WINDOW BLUR ANY MORE (alan, 2026-09-04: "alt tab mid stroke -
	 * sure make it consistent"). A blur mid-stroke now COMMITS what was drawn,
	 * through the router's `finishActiveStroke()` -> `onPenUp` -> `penUp()`,
	 * which is the rule `docs/manual.md` already states for the pdf viewer
	 * rebuilding under the pen. What this method is FOR is the teardown that
	 * really does DROP a stroke - a note switch, where the editor is already
	 * showing a different note and the old note's fragment has nowhere to
	 * land. The pdf surface's twin carries the same split for the same reason.
	 *
	 * Nothing reaches it today, and that is worth saying out loud rather than
	 * leaving for a reader to discover with a grep. Its only caller is
	 * `onStrokeAbandoned`, and the router's one remaining call site for that
	 * callback (the blur handler's second branch) can only run when no stroke
	 * was live, which is exactly when `abandonActiveStroke()` returns false.
	 * The note switch that WOULD want this runs the same teardown inline
	 * instead - `update()`'s path-change branch: `resetGestureState()`, then
	 * `stripPenUp` gated on the boolean, then the wet/tail clears and the
	 * highlighter opacity. Kept as a method, kept wired, and kept executed by
	 * `AbandonedGestureStandsDown.test.ts`, because the callback's contract is
	 * "a stroke was really torn down" and a future caller of that branch could
	 * satisfy it; on the pdf the twin is live code, called by `forgetHistory`.
	 *
	 * The strip first. Such a teardown happens inside the router, where the
	 * `stripPenDown` the contact ran left `is-inking` on the strip and its
	 * collapsed pill (styles.css: opacity 0 AND visibility hidden, so
	 * unhit-testable) until some later stroke completed. Deliberately not
	 * `penUp()`, which commits ink - and committing is exactly what a dropped
	 * stroke must not do.
	 *
	 * THEN THE SURFACE'S OWN STATE, which the chrome-only version left
	 * untouched for two releases. `builder` stays live, the half-drawn stroke
	 * stays painted on the wet layer over a note nobody drew it on, and -
	 * worst of the three because it outlives the gesture - the stroke frame
	 * stays LOCKED, which freezes the camera and every repaint until the next
	 * pen-down (the v0.13.6 lifecycle rule `resetGestureState` states in its
	 * own header). The pdf surface has the identical body under the identical
