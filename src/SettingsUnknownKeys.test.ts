/**
 * A key this build does not know survives a load and a save.
 *
 * `persistSettings` writes the settings object WHOLE - `saveData(this.settings)`,
 * never a merge - and `loadSettings` used to rebuild that object as a literal
 * naming only the keys this build knows. Together those two facts made an
 * older build a settings ERASER: open a vault whose data.json was written by a
 * newer build (or a parallel branch), let anything at all save once, and every
 * key the older build had no line for was gone from the file. The keys are not
 * hypothetical - `inkShaping` is one this repo has already renamed past, and
 * every 1.5.x/1.6.x key in flight is another.
 *
 * The fix is one spread: `loadSettings` spreads the raw file FIRST, then writes
 * the known keys over it. The order is the guarantee, and both halves of it are
 * pinned here - the unknown key rides through, and a known key with a rotten
 * value is still normalised rather than being let through by the spread.
 *
 * HOW IT DRIVES THE REAL METHOD. `loadSettings` and `persistSettings` are both
 * private, and main.ts is a plugin, so this uses the pattern TipModeCommand.ts
 * established: `Object.create(HandwritingPlugin.prototype)` for an instance with
 * no field initialisers, the handful of members the two methods actually touch
 * supplied by hand, and the two DOM-reaching methods (`applyPaperTo`,
 * `applyBooxMode`) shadowed with own properties. Nothing about the settings
 * literal is copied into this file: the object under test is the one main.ts
 * builds, and the assertions re-derive every normalised value by calling the
 * same normaliser main.ts calls rather than restating a number.
