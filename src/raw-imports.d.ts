 * list of files that a new surface is invisible to until someone remembers it.
 *
 * Declared here rather than by adding `vite/client` to tsconfig's `types`:
 * that would pull in vite's own ambient module declarations for `*?raw` and
 * every other asset query alongside this one, which is a large surface to
 * take on for one call. Deliberately narrowed to the exact option shape that
 * yields `Record<string, string>` - `eager` false returns loader functions and
 * a different `query` returns something other than text, so a call written in
 * either of those shapes should not typecheck against this. Verified against
 * the installed vite 8.2.1, where `query: "?raw"` is the spelling; the older
 * `as: "raw"` was removed in vite 6.
