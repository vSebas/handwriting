/**
 * The background-freeze drain is WIRED, not merely present.
 *
 * On iOS and Android the webview is frozen or killed on background with no
 * further JS, so anything mid-debounce - ink sidecars, settings - is lost
 * unless something dispatches the writes synchronously first. `flushOnHide`
 * does that, and `PageStore.flushDispatch` has its own tests.
 *
 * WHAT NOBODY ASSERTED, until this file: that anything CALLS it. alanl-sl
 * found the two `registerDomEvent` lines deletable with the whole suite
 * green - every surface's protection against a swipe-away losing the last
 * strokes, held in place by nothing but the fact that no one had deleted the
 * line. It came out of a negative-control pass that found nine of nineteen
 * inference-based "this is present" verdicts fully vacuous, which is the rule
 * this file is written under: an assertion that a thing EXISTS proves nothing
 * unless someone has watched its absence go red. Both assertions below were.
 *
 * A SOURCE PROBE, deliberately, and this is the one place it is the honest
 * tool rather than the lazy one: the wiring is a `registerDomEvent` on the
 * plugin against the real `document` and `window`, inside `onload`, and a
 * test that constructed a plugin to observe it would be asserting against a
 * fake `registerDomEvent` of its own making - which is exactly the shape of
 * the vacuous verdicts this file exists because of. Read as CODE, never
 * comments, so the comment block above the wiring cannot satisfy it.
